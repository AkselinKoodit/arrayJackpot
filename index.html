    <h1>Let's play with arrays!</h1>
    <p>(in console)</p>
    <h2>Task 1</h2> 
    <p>Create an **array of 5 elements**, each element is a random number of either 1 or 0</p>
    <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <p>Create a while loop, that goes through each element in the array, check if they are 1 or 0</p>
    <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <p>Also create a counter variable to keep track of the number of 1 and 0 values in the array</p>
    <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <p>If the number of 1s is 5, announce the jackpot prize</p>
    <h2>Task 5</h2>
    <p>If the number of 0s is 5, announce the congrat message</p>
    <h2>Task 6</h2>
    <p>If the number of 1s is 3 < x < 5, announce smaller prize</p>
    <h2>Task 7</h2>
    <p>Create a while loop that will run the above application for an undefinite number of time, and only break out of the loop if the jackpot prize is won. </p>
    <h2>Task 8</h2>
    <p>Create a variable to keep track of many rounds have been played in order to win the jackpot</p>
    <h2>Task 9</h2>
    <p>If each round costs 50 cents, run the above program 5 times, either manually or use a while loop to help you, in order to learn the average amount of money you have to spend on winning a jackpot ðŸ˜„ </p>
    <h2>Task 10</h2>
    <p>Increase the random number range to be any number between 0 - 5, run the program on number 9 again to see how much money you would actually have to spend to win a jackpot</p>
    <h2>Task 11</h2>
    <p>If the jackpot prize was 30000 EUR, how much profit/loss do you make? </p>
